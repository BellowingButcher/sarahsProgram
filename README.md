### What Sarah Wants

I need a program that can take an excel file with a team members schedule and read how many opens, closes, cash office, and weekends they work, calculate information on a % bases in a 4 week period.  I want it to be able to update the file while just inputing the next weeks data, the program should automaticaly move week one file into a repo for previous files, move week 2 into week ones slot, week 3 to 2, and then finally the new schedule into week 4. I want to be able to compare the information inbetween each week. (comparing week 1 to 2, or 1 to 3, or 1 to 2 to 3, or 1 to 2 to 3 to 4).
